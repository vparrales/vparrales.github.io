        I began my journey this year, I started taking Computer Hardware and my teacher encouranged me to give a
        presentation about
        other technologies. So I created this site and hopefully after taking and learning more skills
        I can launch an IT business. My future goals for this company would be to become a trusted partner to many
        residents and businesses in
        San Francisco and the surrounding Bay Area.</p>

      <p class="firstletter maininfo textleft">
        I would like to have an ever growing team of highly skilled engineers and consultants coming from diverse
        backgrounds, all
        very passionate about technology, and more importantly all beliving and delivering service with a smile. I would
        like
        to be one of the most highly rated IT Consultants in the Bay Area.
        At Vlads IT Solutions, we believe in delivering exceptional service, enabling
        our customers to make the most out of technology at home and the workplace and beyond.
      </p>
      <h2 class="textleft">Our Culture</h2>
      <p class="firstletter maininfo textleft">
        We don't live in the bubble the typical "IT person" resides. Instead, we value a creative approach to serving
        our customers equally as much as a scientific approach. We also practice what we preach in that we heavily rely
        on the same technology and concepts in our own business that we recommend to our customers.
      </p>
      <p class="firstletter maininfo textleft">
        We say this with immense humility - What we do is important. Hundreds of businesses rely on our services.
        Perhaps more importantly, we rely on each other. Therefore, it is of utmost importance that we do what we say
        weâ€™re going to do. We are dependable people and follow through from beginning to the end.
        <p class="firstletter maininfo textleft">
          Who we are is as important as what we do. We have a unique and eclectic company culture that produces a team
          that works hard, works smart, and perhaps most importantly - has fun. Our team of superstars has many years of
          industry experience in a wide variety of sectors from technology to finance, and everything in between.
