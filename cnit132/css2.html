<h1>Red bold italic heading</h1>
<p>Take a look at the first letter here in this paragraph! It is double the size of the rest of the letters and it should be also bold! This is a great feature to call the attention of the readers when a new paragraph starts. This paragraph is long on purpose as we will be using another style so the first line of the paragraph will be presented in a different style than the rest of the paragraph.</p>
<h3>This heading does not follow any style</h3>
<p>Another paragraph and, again, this has the first letter following the same style you see in the first paragraph!</p>
<p>The following unordered list has a special style!</p>
<ul>
  <li>This is item 1</li>
  <ul>
    <li>This is a sub-item for item 1</li>
    <li>This is a second sub-item for item 1</li>
  </ul>
  <li>This is item 2</li>
  <li>This is item 3</li>
  <ul>
    <li>This is a sub-item for item 3</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
