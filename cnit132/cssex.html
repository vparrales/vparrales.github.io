<h1>Practicing CSS at CNIT 132</h1>
<h2>You will build your CSS file</h2>
<p>You should start this work in the class but you should try finishing or enhancing it at home. CSS requires a lot of training, hands-on coding, researching from your part!</p>
<p>Below, you will find a list of details that you should change in this page so it can look nicer. All should be done using the external CSS file you will be creating.</p>
<h1>References</h1>
<p>Here are some good references for you to use while doing this work:</p>
<ul>
<li>From HTML Dog - http://www.htmldog.com/reference/cssproperties/</li>
<li>CSS properties listed alphabetically - http://www.blooberry.com/indexdot/css/propindex/all.htm</li>
<li>W3 Schools Color picker - http://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_colorpicker.asp</li>
</ul>
<h1>Changes to be made to this site</h1>
<ol>
<li>Create an external CSS file and insert the link tag in the html page to link this page to your external CSS file</li>
<li>Use the @media in your CSS file to create a special CSS that will be used every time you want to print this page - you only want to print the last heading 1 and this list of things to do and all in black color and white background (tip: think about the modification you might need to do in your HTML code to facilitate this part in your CSS)</li>
<li>Give a background color to the page - a cream light color</li>
<li>Put a background image (use the csszoomed.jpg) to the page - it should be on the left side and it should stay there even when you scroll the page down. It should only show up once on the page</li>
<li>Make the first letter of each paragraph to be italic and be double-size of the default font size that shows on the screen</li>
<li>Make all the heading 1 be centralized, italic and in dark blue color</li>
<li>Make all the heading 2 be centralized and in red color</li>
<li>Take out the URL of the unordered list items as the text will need to become a link to the URL written here</li>
<li>Change the color of the links to show up as: link = red underlined text; visited = blue not underlined; mouse over = background yellow, red font no underlined text</li>
<li>Change the item types of the unordered list to show the next.png icon (arrow) instead of a bullet</li>
<li>Change this ordered list to show uppercase alphabetic characters instead of numbers 1, 2, 3, ...</li>
</ol>
