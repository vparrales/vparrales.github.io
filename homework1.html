<!--Vladimir Parrales date goes here 9/8/2018. In order to get this document to HTML5 standards I made the following changes. Starting from the top I noticed that
the the html tag was missing the DOCTYPE declaration. Next, I took note that the head tag was missing its closing tag so I added that.
I made sure that the title tag was nested in between the head tags and I added a meta tag with the attribute charset="utf-8" to specify the character encoding for the HTML document.
Below the opening body tag I noticed that the opening h1 tag was missing the closing carrot so I added that and un capped the closing
h1 tag. Below that I noticed that the first, thrid, four and six paragragh tags were missing closing </p> tags. So I went ahead and corrected those. Below that I un capped the
opening and closing <h2> tags-->
<!DOCTYPE html lang="en">

    <h1 style= "text-align:center">CNIT-132 Homework 1</h1>
    <p>In this homework we will be changing this code to be a valid code in HTML5.</p>
    <p>We will probably need to change a lot of details around the code and the basic idea of this Homework is to learn how to use the validator from W3C.</p>
    <p><img style="float:left;" src="oldboat.gif">The image you see here will be used a lot in many exercises we will be doing in class! This is an old boat,
    probably an old ship. One of those types used to transport heavy cargo in the old times?!?! Of course this picture is not real, but you can imagine a big
    boat made basically of wood and using the main power of the wind! Remember that this picture needs to be uploaded to the Hills Server (your account)
    together with this file you are modifying, otherwise, the picture will not be shown!</p>
    <p>You will be able to change a little bit the content of the two paragraphs below to insert the links requested to make sense when reading the content.</p>

    <p>Include here below a horizontal ruler to divide the page</p>

    <h2>Subtitle of our page</h2>
    <p>It's funny to see this page being upgraded<br>
    We will be dealing with a lot of details in this code<br>
    and that's the idea of this exercise!</p>
    <section>
      <p>At least I am using one new HTML5 tag - the section tag. Not sure if I am using it correctly!</p>
    </section>
    <p>I am trying to build an unordered list here below. Would you be able to help me?</p>
    <ul>
    <li>planning a web page</li>
    <li>studying the target audience</li>
    <li>following standards when coding</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Make sure you upload your file to Hills, inside the public_html folder, make sure also to upload the image of the oldboat but, especially for his work, make sure you validate your code!
