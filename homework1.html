    <p>In this homework we will be changing this code to be a valid code in HTML5.</p>
    <p>We will probably need to change a lot of details around the code and the basic idea of this Homework is to learn how to use the validator from W3C.</p>
    <p><img style="float:left;" src="oldboat.gif" alt="Cargo Boat">The image you see here will be used a lot in many exercises we will be doing in class! This is an old boat,
    probably an old ship. One of those types used to transport heavy cargo in the old times?!?! Of course this picture is not real, but you can imagine a big
    boat made basically of wood and using the main power of the wind! Remember that this picture needs to be uploaded to the Hills Server (your account)
    together with this file you are modifying, otherwise, the picture will not be shown!</p>
    <p>You will be able to change a little bit the content of the two paragraphs below to insert the links requested to make sense when reading the content.</p>

    <p>The Mozilla Developer Network is a great resource for learning web development. It provides great articles for 
      beginners in order to start coding simple web pages. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn#wiki-document-head">Learn Web Development!</a></p>
    <p>If you are a new or returning student make sure to meet with a counselor at least twice a semester to stay on track with your academic
      courses and career path. The members of the counseling team are here to help. Don't miss out on meeting with a great CCSF counselor today!

    <h2>Subtitle of our page</h2>
    <p>It's funny to see this page being upgraded<br>
    We will be dealing with a lot of details in this code<br>
    and that's the idea of this exercise!</p>
    <section>
    <h3>Section elements typically have a heading</h3>
      <p>At least I am using one new HTML5 tag - the section tag. Not sure if I am using it correctly!</p>
    </section>
    <p>I am trying to build an unordered list here below. Would you be able to help me?</p>
    <ul>
    <li>planning a web page</li>
    <li>studying the target audience</li>
    <li>following standards when coding</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Make sure you upload your file to Hills, inside the public_html folder, make sure also to upload the image of the oldboat but, especially for his work, make sure you validate your code!

<!--Vladimir Parrales 9/8/2018. In order to get this document to HTML5 standards I made the following changes. 
Starting from the top I noticed that the the html tag was missing the !DOCTYPE declaration. Next I added the opening html tag with
the lang="en" attribute. I took note that the head tag was missing its closing tag so I added that. I made sure that the title tag was
nested in between the head tags and I added a meta tag with the attribute charset="utf-8" to specify the character encoding for the HTML
document. Below the opening body tag I noticed that the opening h1 tag was missing the closing carrot so I added that and un capped 
the closing h1 tag. The image tag was missing the alt="" atrribute so I added that with the detail Cargo Boat.Below that I noticed that 
the first, thrid, four and six paragragh tags were missing closing </p> tags. So I went ahead and corrected those. Below that I un 
capped the opening and closing <h2> element. I added two links, one to a great resource to learning web development and the other to 
CCSF's student counceling page. In both links I added an id section from the page so that it can take the viewer directly to those 
sections. I edited the paragraphs so there is a relationship to the links and the pages being visited. In the opening anchor tag I 
added two attributes aside from the href. One being the target attribute so that the link will open in another tag and also the 
relation attribute with the value "noopener" to prevent a threat to the security of the original page.-->
